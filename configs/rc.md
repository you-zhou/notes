The "rc" in filenames like `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` stands for "run commands". These files are shell script files that are executed when a new shell session is started. In other words, they are initialization files that configure the behavior of your shell.

Here's a bit more explanation:

- **`~/.bashrc`:** This file is used to configure settings related to your Bash shell. It can include variables, functions, and various settings that apply to your interactive Bash sessions. When you open a new terminal window or tab that uses Bash, the `~/.bashrc` file gets sourced.

- **`~/.zshrc`:** Similar to `~/.bashrc`, but for the Zsh shell. It is executed when you start a new Zsh shell session.

These files are usually located in the user's home directory (`~` is shorthand for the home directory) and are hidden files (as denoted by the `.` prefix).

### Best Practice Tips

- Use these files to set up environment variables, aliases, and default settings that you want in every shell session.
- You can split complex configurations into separate files and source them in your main `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for better organization.
- Test your changes on a separate terminal session to ensure that they don't produce errors before applying them to your main session.

By customizing these files, you can create a shell environment that is optimized for your workflow.
