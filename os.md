# Operating System

## /etc

> In Linux and Unix-based systems, "/etc" is a directory that is used to store **system configuration files** that are needed by various system utilities, daemons, and services.
The name "/etc" stands for =="et cetera,"== which means "and so on" or "and other things" in Latin. The idea behind this naming convention is that the directory contains miscellaneous files that don't belong in other directories.
The "/etc" directory typically contains a variety of configuration files, including:
System-wide configuration files for various services and daemons, such as Apache, SSH, and MySQL.
Configuration files for system-level applications, such as the crontab scheduler and the fstab file system table.
Administrative scripts and scripts used during the boot process.
Various other configuration files and system-related data.
Since the files in the "/etc" directory are often critical to the proper functioning of the system, they are typically owned by the "root" user and are not accessible to regular users.

## /var

> In Linux and Unix-based systems, "/var" is a directory that is used to store **variable data files** that are generated by system processes and applications during runtime. The name "/var" stands for =="variable,"== which refers to the fact that the files stored in this directory can change in size and content over time.
The "/var" directory typically contains a variety of files, including:
Log files generated by system processes and applications, which are stored in the "**/var/log**" subdirectory.
Spool files for print queues and other system spools, which are stored in the "/var/spool" subdirectory.
Lock files used to indicate that a resource is in use by a process, which are stored in the "**/var/lock**" subdirectory.
Cached data used by various system services, such as package managers and DNS resolvers, which are stored in the "/var/cache" subdirectory.
Temporary files used by applications and processes, which are stored in the "**/var/tmp**" subdirectory.
The "/var" directory is often stored on a separate partition or disk, to ensure that it has enough space to accommodate the variable data files generated by system processes and applications.
Since the files in the "/var" directory are often critical to the proper functioning of the system, they are typically owned by the "root" user and are not accessible to regular users.
